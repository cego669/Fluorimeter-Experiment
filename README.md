# Fluorimeter Experiment

*This project contains some calculations perfomed with data collected using a fluorimeter for a specific sample. It was used for a report during the classes of Experimental Techniques II, at Universidade Federal de Goi√°s (UFG).*

**Description:** for the specific sample (read reference for more informations), the emission spectrum was plotted, and it's dependence with temperature were explored. The CIE coordinates were calculated and didn't change significantly with temperature. There was agreement between the results obtained and the results from the reference.
